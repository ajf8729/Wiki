# Intro
This guide was made with simplicity in mind, just enough to get you going with a working bitlocker configuration.

While bitlocker can be configured in various ways, for simplicities sake we will stick with the endpoint security node in the intune admin portal

> This guide was tested on a Entra only environment, no legacy devices were considered.
