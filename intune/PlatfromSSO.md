# Platform SSO
In order to enable SSO on Mac Devices, and enabling users to log in with their Entra Credentials, Platform SSO need to be deployed. Previously, there were three other tools to achieve similar things, namely Domain Join, Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in, and Kerberos SSO, Platform SSO combines them in one tool to deploy.

# Prerequisites
1. macOS 13.0 and newer
2. Microsoft Intune Company Portal app version 5.2404.0 and newer deployed 
3. Microsoft Single Sign On extension if Chrome is getting used

> On how to deploy Cloud Kerberos Trust to access local file shares without an password see [whfb-cloud-kerberos-trust](/active-directory/whfb-cloud-kerberos-trust).
