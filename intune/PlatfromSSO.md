# Platform SSO
In order to enable SSO on MacOS Devices, and enabling users to log in with their Entra Credentials, Platform SSO needs to be deployed. Previously, there were three other tools to achieve a similar functionality, namely Domain Join, Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in, and Kerberos SSO, Platform SSO combines them in one tool to deploy, it is the Microsoft **prefered and recommended** option.

# Prerequisites
1. macOS 13.0 and newer
2. Microsoft Intune Company Portal app version 5.2404.0 and newer deployed to the devices
3. [Microsoft Single Sign On extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/microsoft-single-sign-on/ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji) if Chrome is getting used

> On how to deploy Cloud Kerberos Trust to access local file shares without an password see [whfb-cloud-kerberos-trust](/active-directory/whfb-cloud-kerberos-trust).

# Deploying Platform SSO

> Microsoft recommends using **Secure Enclave** as the authentication method when configuring Platform SSO

## Intune

MS Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/configuration/platform-sso-macos

1. Create the Extensible Single Sign On (SSO) Intune Settings Catalogue Policy

2. Enter these values and deploy the policy

3. The user is getting prompted, to login with MFA in order to enable Platfrom SSO and to join the device to entra

# Adding Non-Microsoft apps
1. In order to enable SSO on non-Microsoft apps select Extension Data in the settings picker

2.  In Extension Data, Add the following keys and values:
![extension-data-appprefixallowlist.png](/extension-data-appprefixallowlist.png)

- AppPrefixAllowList 
Type: String
Value: The prefixes of your apps (eg. com.fortinet., com.apple. ...) 

> You can get the full app name in the intune portal, or if you enter osasscript -e 'id of app "You app name"' in the terminal of an mac.
{.is-info}


- browser_sso_interaction_enabled 
Type: Integer
Value: 1

- disable_explicit_app_prompt 
Type: Integer
Value: 1

# Validating Functionality & Troubleshooting
To verify, if Platfrom SSO has been deployed sucesfully, enter app-sso platform -s into the terminal, on an mac and you should see an SSO Token. 

Note: The Microsoft Intune Company Portal functions as the authentication broker, if the app stops working, the authentication breaks.
