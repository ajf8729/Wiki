# Windows Subscription Activation
This page will shortly explain how subscription activation works and what to look out for.

## How do I know if my computer is subscription activated?
Press `Windows key + R` and enter `ms-settings:activation`. A successful subscription activation looks like this:

## My computer looks different
You may look at a "Pro" activation instead. The key for this can be a MAK, Retail or OEM (UEFI/BIOS embedded) source. Even a KMS key will look like this.

If your MSA (Microsoft personal accounts) that you're signed in with has a key it will look like this:
